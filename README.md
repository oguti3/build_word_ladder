Description: This program allows the user to build a word ladder, in which each word is one character 
different than the one above and below it. User starts by inputting a specified word length, then inputs a 
specified max ladder height, then a start and final word. These can also be inputted using command-line 
arguments which are "-n", "-m", "-d", "-s", and "-f" respectively. Starting from the start word user is then 
asked to input valid words until you reach the final word AND have number of words equal to ladder height, 
otherwise program will terminate with an incomplete ladder.
